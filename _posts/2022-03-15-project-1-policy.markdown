## Background

The Shuiyuan Public Market in Taipei holds a significant place in the city's history and culture. Originally constructed in 1990 to enhance the cityscape and accommodate nearby vendors, the market has undergone several renovations over the years.  
One of the most notable renovations occurred in 2010 when the Taipei City Government invited Israeli artist Yaacov Agam to create a large-scale public art piece titled 'Heart of Shuiyuan.' This art installation, situated within the modernized building, has since become a distinctive landmark in the Gongguan district.

**The second floor of the market caters to shoppers seeking a range of products**, from clothing to household items. With its affordable prices and diverse offerings, the market attracts locals and tourists alike.
