    <h3>1. Reignite the Hebin Market Reconstruction Project after a 6-month Standstill</h3>
    <p>The reconstruction project for Hebin Market is essential due to the inadequate seismic resilience of the existing buildings. Initially, there was disagreement between our office and market vendors regarding the location of the temporary market. Our proposal to use a parking area faced resistance from vendors, who argued that their predominantly large electromechanical merchandise and customer base arriving by car made it inconvenient to transport purchases from distant parking areas.</p>
    <p>Through extensive facilitation of discussions and numerous meetings involving government officials, elected representatives, and market vendors, the impasse was successfully resolved. As a result, the reconstruction project was back on track, overcoming a six-month standstill.</p>

    <h3>2. Facilitate the Construction Process of the Temporary Market</h3>
    <p>To ensure a streamlined construction process for the temporary market, I continuously verify requirements with market vendors, confirming equipment and building needs such as second-floor mezzanines.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I assist in small procurements for tasks like air conditioning and internet installation. Collaborating closely with the construction department and architects, I supervise construction activities to maintain standards of quality and efficiency.</p>

    <h3>3. Supervise and Assist the Re-Election of The Market's Committee Members</h3>
    <p>To ensure transparency and fairness in governance and foster market development, my responsibility includes overseeing the integrity and smoothness of the voting and ballot counting process.</p>
