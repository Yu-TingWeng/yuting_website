    <h3>1. Reignite the Hebin Market Reconstruction Project after a 6-month Standstill</h3>
    <h5>Related Links</h5>
    <p>The reconstruction project for Hebin Market is essential due to the inadequate seismic resilience of the existing buildings. Initially, there was disagreement between our office and market vendors regarding the location of the temporary market. Our proposal to use a parking area faced resistance from vendors, who argued that their predominantly large electromechanical merchandise and customer base arriving by car made it inconvenient to transport purchases from distant parking areas.</p>
    <p>Through extensive facilitation of discussions and numerous meetings involving government officials, elected representatives, and market vendors, the impasse was successfully resolved. As a result, the reconstruction project was back on track, overcoming a six-month standstill.</p>
