    <h3>2. Resolve Building's Safety Concerns</h3>
    <p>In 2021, Shuiyuan Market faced public safety concerns due to the absence of 12 cm RC walls, as mandated by the original construction permit license, to separate the first and second floors and prevent fire damage. <br><br> Vendors disputed their existence since the market's inception, leading to reluctance in their installation. Collaborating with architects, my office and I sought an alternative solution acceptable to all vendors and regulations. After extensive discussions involving construction and management offices, scholars, experts, and vendors, an agreement was reached to install rolling fire doors next to the escalators, ensuring safety without disrupting vendors' operations.</p>

    <h3>4. Provide Essential Guidelines for Hygienic Practices</h3>
    <p>Offering essential guidelines for hygienic practices ensures a safe and healthy environment for both vendors and customers. Alongside emphasizing proper handwashing techniques, sanitization protocols, and maintaining cleanliness in shared spaces, adhering to guidelines for handling meat and food products, regular maintenance of equipment such as exhaust hoods are also advised and promoted in the market.</p>
