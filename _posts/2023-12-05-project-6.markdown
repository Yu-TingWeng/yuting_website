    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>In this project, we applied <b>sentiment analysis and natural language processing (NLP) techniques</b> to investigate the relationship between online discussions on Reddit's Wallstreetbets Subreddit and official Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statements with movements in the stock market. <br> This endeavor showcased our adeptness in web scraping methodologies, where we utilized various tools including the <b>Selenium</b> package for retrieving FOMC statements, <b>PRAW</b> for collecting Reddit posts, and <b>yfinance</b> for obtaining stock prices. <br> We also created two apps, with <b>Dash and Shiny</b>, to craft dynamic dashboards showcasing our findings and interactive graphs. This hands-on experience not only honed our analytical skills but also deepened our understanding of market dynamics and the intersection of online discourse with financial trends.</p>
