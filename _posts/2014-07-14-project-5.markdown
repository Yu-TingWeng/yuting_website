description: "I focused on analyzing the 'Stress Detection from Social Media Articles' dataset obtained from Kaggle. I utilized GPT models with three distinct techniques: Zero-Shot Prompting, Few-Shot Prompting, and Fine-tuning the GPT2 Model. These techniques were employed to effectively classify stress-related posts within the dataset, aiming to enhance understanding and detection of stress signals in social media discourse."
