description: In this project, we applied sentiment analysis and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to investigate the relationship between online discussions on Reddit and official Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statements with movements in the stock market. <br> This endeavor showcased our adeptness in web scraping methodologies, where we utilized various tools including the Selenium package for retrieving FOMC statements, PRAW for collecting Reddit posts, and yfinance for obtaining stock prices. <br> We also created two apps, with Dash and Shiny, to craft dynamic dashboards showcasing our findings and interactive graphs. This hands-on experience not only honed our analytical skills but also deepened our understanding of market dynamics and the intersection of online discourse with financial trends.
