description: In this project, we applied _sentiment analysis_ and _natural language processing (NLP)_ techniques to investigate the relationship between online discussions on Reddit and official Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statements with movements in the stock market. <br> This endeavor showcased our adeptness in _web scraping_ methodologies, where we utilized various tools including the _Selenium_ package for retrieving FOMC statements, _PRAW_ for collecting Reddit posts, and _yfinance_ for obtaining stock prices. <br> We also created two apps, with _Dash_ and _Shiny_, to craft dynamic dashboards showcasing our findings and interactive graphs. This hands-on experience not only honed our analytical skills but also deepened our understanding of market dynamics and the intersection of online discourse with financial trends.
